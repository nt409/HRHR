# HRHR project

## Model

Model based on those of Hobbelen and Elderfield. Two high risk fungicides - we model how the pathogen population becomes more resistant as the fungicides are applied over a number of years.

## TODO
- read Hobbelen/Alexey/Bliss independence
- plan paper
- what is known about chemicals
- future work: do fcides work independently
- effect of how dose/decay modelled?
- cross-res
