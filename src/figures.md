# Figures

---
## Single

1. yield for single tactic over number of years
1. res. freqs. for ""
1. DPC for single year - within season


## Changing dose

1. changes in SR according to dose and RF

#### TODO:

1. effect of sex on this effect - bar charts to show effect of sex
1. something about high doses - quadratic plot?

---
## Grid

1. contour (yield/TY/LTY)
1. Fix one fcide, scan over others. For each fcide pair:

    Show equal selection is best.
    
    Log ratio of resistance in final year vs failure year, and then heatmap in dose space.

    Test contours: $y= k - x$ then heatmap in dose space.

#### TODO:

1. Try something like: "after failed, spray at full dose"? So that not just unfair on other tactics

1. Fix one fcide, scan over others. For each fcide pair:

    Show min/max dose is best.

    $x+y$ vs failure year, and then heatmap in dose space

    Test contours: $y= 2^n x$ then heatmap in dose space.
