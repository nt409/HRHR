## How should fungicides be used?

- show for different efficacies, RFs that best results with:
    - **equal selection**
    - min or max dose
- mention small region of parameter space where high doses good initially
- show mix better than alternate

---

## Figures to include

### Introduction
### Methods - explain model
### Results

###### Introduce model

1. DPC
1. yield/res freq for a single tactic over a number of years - as subplot

###### Equal selection is best way to pick doses

1. Heat map/Log ratio plot

###### High or low dose?

1. Heat map/dose ratio plot

1. Along equal selection contour... changes in SR according to dose and RF - for sex or no sex **TODO**

###### When does this recommendation work?

1. Show it's good for a few cases (change fungicide efficacy/decay, amount of sex, and initial frequencies) - **TODO**

### Discussion

Explain about time variable tactics
